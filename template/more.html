                What is breast cancer?
                </h2>
            </li>
            <p>Breast cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the breast. It can start in one or both breasts.</p>
            <p>Cancer starts when cells begin to grow out of control. (To learn more about how cancers start and spread)</p>
            <p>Breast cancer occurs almost entirely in women, but men can get breast cancer, too.</p>
            <p><strong>It's important to understand that most breast lumps are benign and not cancer (malignant).</strong> 
            Non-cancer breast tumors are abnormal growths, but they do not spread outside of the breast. 
            They are not life threatening, but some types of benign breast lumps can increase a woman's 
            risk of getting breast cancer. Any breast lump or change needs to be checked by a health care 
            professional to find out if it is benign or malignant (cancer) and if it might affect yours future 
            cancer risk.</p>
            <h2>Where breast cancer starts?</h2>
            <p>Breast cancers can start from different parts of the breast. The breast is an organ that sits on 
                top of the upper ribs and chest muscles. There is a left and right breast and each one has mainly 
                glands, ducts, and fatty tissue. In women, the breast makes and delivers milk to feed newborns and infants. 
                The amount of fatty tissue in the breast determines the size of each breast.</p>
            <p>The breast has different parts:</p>
                <li>- <strong>Lobules</strong> are the glands that make breast milk. Cancers that start here are called <strong>lobular cancers.</strong></li>
                <li>- <strong>Ducts</strong> are small canals that come out from the lobules and carry the milk to the nipple. 
                This is the most common place for breast cancer to start. Cancers that start here are called <strong>ductal cancers</strong>.</li>
                <li>- The <strong>nipple</strong> is the opening in the skin of the breast where the ducts come together and turn into larger ducts 
                so the milk can leave the breast. The nipple is surrounded by slightly darker thicker skin called the <strong>areola</strong>. 
                A less common type of breast cancer called Paget disease of the breast can start in the nipple.</li>
                <li>- The <strong>fat and connective tissue (stroma)</strong> surround the ducts and lobules and help keep them in place. 
                A less common type of breast cancer called phyllodes tumor can start in the stroma.</li>
                <li>- <strong>Blood vessels</strong> and <strong>lymph vessels</strong> are also found in each breast. 
                Angiosarcoma is a less common type of breast cancer that can start in the lining of these vessels. The lymph system is described below. </li>
            <p>A small number of cancers start in other tissues in the breast. These cancers are called sarcomas and lymphomas and are not really thought of as breast cancers.</p>

            <p>
                <p><h2>How breast cancer spreads?</h2></p>
                <p>Breast cancer can spread when the cancer cells get into the blood or lymph system and then are carried to other parts of the body. </p>
                <p>The lymph (or lymphatic) system is a part of your body's immune system. It is a network of lymph nodes (small, bean-sized glands), 
                    ducts or vessels, and organs that work together to collect and carry clear lymph fluid through the body tissues to the blood. 
                    The clear lymph fluid inside the lymph vessels contains tissue by-products and waste material, as well as immune system cells. </p>
                <p><span>The lymph vessels carry lymph fluid away from the breast. In the case of breast cancer, cancer cells can enter those lymph vessels 
                    and start to grow in lymph nodes. Most of the lymph vessels of the breast drain into:</span></p>
                <ul><li>Lymph nodes under the arm (<strong>axillary</strong> lymph nodes)</li>
                <li>Lymph nodes inside the chest near the breastbone (<strong>internal mammary</strong> lymph nodes)</li>
                <li>Lymph nodes around the collar bone (<strong>supraclavicular</strong> [above the collar bone] and <strong>infraclavicular</strong> 
                    [below the collar bone] lymph nodes)</li></ul>
            </p>
            <p>If cancer cells have spread to your lymph nodes, there is a higher chance that the cells could have traveled through the lymph system and spread 
                (metastasized) to other parts of your body. Still, not all women with cancer cells in their lymph nodes develop metastases, and some women with no 
                cancer cells in their lymph nodes might develop metastases later.</p>

        <div>
            <h2>Types of breast cancer</h2>
            <p>There are many different types of breast cancer. The type is determined by the specific kind of cells in the breast that are affected. 
                Most breast cancers are <strong>carcinomas</strong>. The most common breast cancers such as ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and invasive carcinoma are 
                <strong>adenocarcinomas</strong>, since the cancers start in the gland cells in the milk ducts or the lobules (milk-producing glands). Other kinds of cancers can grow 
                in the breast, like angiosarcoma or sarcoma, but are not considered breast cancer since they start in different cells of the breast.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Causes</h2>
            <p>It's not clear what causes most angiosarcomas, though doctors have identified factors that may increase your risk of the disease.</p>
            <p>Doctors know that something happens that causes a cell in the lining of a blood vessel or lymph vessel to develop an error (mutation) in its genetic code. 
                The mutation tells the cell to grow quickly, making more abnormal cells. The abnormal cells continue living when other cells would die.</p>
            <p>The result is a buildup of abnormal cells that grows from the affected blood vessel or lymph vessel. With time, cells may break off and spread 
                (metastasize) to other areas of the body.</p>

            <h3>Inherited breast cancer</h3>
            <p>Doctors estimate that about 5 to 10 percent of breast cancers are linked to gene mutations passed through generations of a family.</p>
            <p>A number of inherited mutated genes that can increase the likelihood of breast cancer have been identified. 
                The most well-known are breast cancer gene 1 (BRCA1) and breast cancer gene 2 (BRCA2), 
                both of which significantly increase the risk of both breast and ovarian cancer.</p>
            <p>Consider asking your doctor for a referral to a genetic counselor, who can review your family health history. 
                A genetic counselor can also discuss the benefits, risks and limitations of genetic testing to assist you with shared decision-making.</p>

            <h2>Risk factors</h2>
            <p>A breast cancer risk factor is anything that makes it more likely you'll get breast cancer. 
                But having one or even several breast cancer risk factors doesn't necessarily mean you'll develop breast cancer. 
                Many women who develop breast cancer have no known risk factors other than simply being women.</p>
            <p>Factors that are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Being female.</strong> Women are much more likely than men are to develop breast cancer.</li>
                <li><strong>Increasing age.</strong> Your risk of breast cancer increases as you age.</li>
                <li><strong>A personal history of breast conditions.</strong> If you've had a breast biopsy that found lobular carcinoma in 
                    situ (LCIS) or atypical hyperplasia of the breast, you have an increased risk of breast cancer.</li>
                <li><strong>A personal history of breast cancer.</strong> If you've had breast cancer in one breast, you have an 
                    increased risk of developing cancer in the other breast.</li>
                <li><strong>A family history of breast cancer.</strong> If your mother, sister or daughter was diagnosed with breast cancer, 
                    particularly at a young age, your risk of breast cancer is increased. Still, the majority of people diagnosed 
                    with breast cancer have no family history of the disease.</li>
                <li><strong>Inherited genes that increase cancer risk.</strong> Certain gene mutations that increase the risk of breast cancer can be 
                    passed from parents to children. The most well-known gene mutations are referred to as BRCA1 and BRCA2. 
                    These genes can greatly increase your risk of breast cancer and other cancers, but they don't make cancer inevitable.</li>
                <li><strong>Radiation exposure.</strong> If you received radiation treatments to your chest as a child or young adult, 
                    your risk of breast cancer is increased.</li>
                <li><strong>Obesity.</strong> Being obese increases your risk of breast cancer.</li>
                <li><strong>Beginning your period at a younger age.</strong> Beginning your period before age 12 increases your risk of breast cancer.</li>
                <li><strong>Beginning menopause at an older age.</strong> If you began menopause at an older age, you're more likely to develop breast cancer.</li>
                <li><strong>Having your first child at an older age.</strong> Women who give birth to their first child after age 30 may have an increased risk of 
                    breast cancer.</li>
                <li><strong>Having never been pregnant.</strong> Women who have never been pregnant have a greater risk of breast cancer than do women who have had one or more pregnancies.</li>
                <li><strong>Postmenopausal hormone therapy.</strong> Women who take hormone therapy medications that combine estrogen and progesterone to treat the signs 
                    and symptoms of menopause have an increased risk of breast cancer. The risk of breast cancer decreases when women stop taking these medications.</li>
                <li><strong>Drinking alcohol.</strong> Drinking alcohol increases the risk of breast cancer.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2><strong>Prevention</strong></h2>
            <h3>Breast cancer risk reduction for women with an average risk</h3>
            <li>Making changes in your daily life may help reduce your risk of breast cancer. Try to:</li>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ask your doctor about breast cancer screening.</strong> Discuss with your doctor when to begin breast cancer screening exams and tests, 
                    such as clinical breast exams and mammograms. Talk to your doctor about the benefits and risks of screening. 
                    Together, you can decide what breast cancer screening strategies are right for you.</li>
                <li><p><strong>Become familiar with your breasts through breast self-exam for breast awareness.</strong> 
                    Women may choose to become familiar with their breasts by occasionally inspecting their breasts 
                    during a breast self-exam for breast awareness. If there is a new change, lumps or other unusual signs 
                    in your breasts, talk to your doctor promptly.</p>
                    <p>Breast awareness can't prevent breast cancer, but it may help you to better understand the normal 
                        changes that your breasts undergo and identify any unusual signs and symptoms.</p></li>
                <li><strong>Drink alcohol in moderation, if at all.</strong> Limit the amount of alcohol you drink to no more than one drink a day, 
                    if you choose to drink.</li>
                <li><strong>Exercise most days of the week.</strong> Aim for at least 30 minutes of exercise on most days of the week. 
                    If you haven't been active lately, ask your doctor whether it's OK and start slowly.</li>
                <li><p><strong>Limit postmenopausal hormone therapy.</strong> Combination hormone therapy may increase the risk of breast cancer. 
                    Talk with your doctor about the benefits and risks of hormone therapy.</p>
                    <p>Some women experience bothersome signs and symptoms during menopause and, for these women, 
                        the increased risk of breast cancer may be acceptable in order to relieve menopause signs and symptoms.</p>
                    <p>To reduce the risk of breast cancer, use the lowest dose of hormone therapy possible for the shortest amount of time.</p></li>
                <li><strong>Maintain a healthy weight.</strong> If your weight is healthy, work to maintain that weight. If you need to lose weight, ask your 
                    doctor about healthy strategies to accomplish this. Reduce the number of calories you eat each day and slowly increase the amount of exercise.</li>
                <li><strong>Choose a healthy diet.</strong> Women who eat a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil and mixed nuts may have a 
                    reduced risk of breast cancer. The Mediterranean diet focuses mostly on plant-based foods, such as fruits and vegetables, whole grains, 
                    legumes, and nuts. People who follow the Mediterranean diet choose healthy fats, such as olive oil, over butter and fish instead of red meat.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Breast cancer risk reduction for women with a high risk</h3>
            <li>If your doctor has assessed your family history and determined that you have other factors, such as a precancerous breast condition, 
                that increase your risk of breast cancer, you may discuss options to reduce your risk, such as:</li>
            <ul><li><strong>Preventive medications (chemoprevention).</strong> Estrogen-blocking medications, such as selective estrogen receptor 
                modulators and aromatase inhibitors, reduce the risk of breast cancer in women with a high risk of the disease.These medications carry a 
                risk of side effects, so doctors reserve these medications for women who have a very high risk of breast cancer. 
                Discuss the benefits and risks with your doctor.</li>
                <li><strong>Preventive surgery.</strong> Women with a very high risk of breast cancer may choose to have their healthy breasts surgically 
                    removed (prophylactic mastectomy). They may also choose to have their healthy ovaries removed (prophylactic oophorectomy) 
                    to reduce the risk of both breast cancer and ovarian cancer.</li></ul>

            <h2>Is breast cancer painful?</h2>
            <p>A lump or a mass in the breast is oftenTrusted Source one of the first signs of breast cancer. In many cases, these lumps are painless. A person may experience pain in the nipple or breast area that appears to be tied to their menstrual cycle.

                Pain caused by breast cancer is typically gradual. Anyone who experiences breast pain, especially if it is severe or persistent, 
                should consult a healthcare professional.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>When to see a doctor</h2>
            <p>If you find a lump or other change in your breast — even if a recent mammogram was normal — make an appointment with your doctor for prompt evaluation.</p>
